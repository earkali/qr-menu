## üñ•Ô∏è Customization Guide

### 1. **Restaurant Name, Address, and Contact Info**
- Edit these fields in `src/App.jsx`:
  ```js
  // Restaurant name
  <h1>Lezzet Kapƒ±sƒ±</h1>
  // Address and phone are in the footer
  ```

### 2. **Social Media & Map Links**
- In `src/App.jsx`:
  ```js
  const socialLinks = {
    googleMaps: 'https://maps.google.com/?q=YOUR_RESTAURANT_ADDRESS',
    instagram: 'https://instagram.com/YOUR_INSTAGRAM',
    facebook: 'https://facebook.com/YOUR_FACEBOOK'
  };
  ```
- Replace with your own links.

### 3. **Using Your Own QR Code**
- The QR code automatically shows the current site address.
- If you deploy to your own domain, the QR code will point to that domain.
- To download the QR code, open the QR modal, right-click the image, and save it.

### 4. **Managing Categories & Products**

- Add, edit, or delete categories and products. Upload images by selecting or dragging files.
- All changes are instantly visible.

### 5. **Admin Panel Login & Changing Password**
- **Default username:** `admin`
- **Default password:** `admin123`
- To change the password:
  - Find this line in `src/components/Login.jsx`:
    ```js
    if (username === 'admin' && password === 'admin123') {
    ```
  - Change the username and password as you wish.
  - **Note:** For production, a backend or database is recommended for security.
